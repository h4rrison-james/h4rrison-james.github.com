My co-founder [John Verran](http://twitter.com/johnaverran) and I recently competed in the [Profectus](http://profectus.org.au/) 'The Pitch' event at UWA, presenting our tutoring startup [Tutoric](www.tutoric.com). Building what was essentially the only decent presentation we had ever made, we learnt a few things along the way (namely, don't use PowerPoint).

After a bit of research perusing the amazing presentations by [Emiland de Cubber](http://emiland.me/) we decided to go with Apple Keynote over Microsoft PowerPoint. Having never really used the iWork suite before I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but it's safe to say I won't be going back.

The number one feature that stood out using Keynote was its amazing rulers and snap-to-grid layouts. Like PowerPoint, Keynote will snap objects in to position when they align with other objects on the slide, but unlike PowerPoint, temporary rulers and guides will show up giving you some insight into why an objects is snapping to a particular location. They're quite intelligent, recognising even spacing between multiple objects of the same type, and snapping entire groups of objects to the centre of the slide.

For fonts, we went with something custom. All the system fonts have either been overused or are far from subtle. A custom font can set you back hundreds of dollars, but there are some nicely designed ones over at the [Lost Type Co-Op](http://losttype.com/) that you can name your price for. Although not particularly useful for slide design, we found that [Adobe Typekit](http://typekit.com/) was a great resource for building websites.

Every presentation needs icons, and you certainly shouldn't use the mostly hideous Microsoft Clipart. There are a huge amount of icons available at [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/), many of them released under a creative commons license. Icons are provided in SVG, which while a great format doesn't play nice with Keynote. [The PNG Project](http://thepngproject.com/) allows you to download icons from The Noun Project in PNG format, which work fine so long as you don't choose dimensions that are too small.

For colours, you can either use [Adobe Kuler](www.adobe.com/products/kuler.htmlâ€Ž), which is basically a list of user curated colour palettes, or find a website you like the look of and steal their colours using a colour picker ([ColorZilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/) works well).

All in all, designing a presentation, rather than simply making one, takes an enormous amount of testing, adjusting, iterating, and fiddling. In the end though, you get a presentation that looks different, and has a unique feel, which in my opinion is worth it.

Oh, and don't use transitions. Ever.
