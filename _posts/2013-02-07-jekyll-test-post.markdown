My last article about thorium as an alternative nuclear reactor fuel drew way more readers than I expected. I intentionally glossed over the complexities of specific reactor designs for the sake of simplicity, but in this article I want to go deeper. This article explains some of the differences between traditional uranium reactors and molten salt thorium reactors (MSRs).

Traditional uranium reactors are by far the most common type of reactor around the world. This includes all 359 Light Water Reactors and 31 Heavy Water Reactors in operation today. These reactors use a solid uranium fuel loaded into fuel rods, moderated by water.

Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were selected in 2002 as one of six future “Generation IV” reactor designs. They were researched heavily in the 1950s and 60s at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The results of the experiments were considered extremely promising, but the competing Liquid Metal Fast Breeder reactor design won out politically for follow-up funding in 1970, and the MSR program was canceled.
