When it came time to begin writing my final year thesis for engineering, I realised very quickly that I faced a dilemma: put up with the woefully inadequate Microsoft Word, which I knew would eventually get the job done, or face many hours troubleshooting a more complicated [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) setup, potentially wasting days before I could even start writing. 

Suffice to say, it didn't take very long for me to make my decision. One look at the beautifully typeset, evenly spaced, automatically referenced magic that was LaTeX and I was sold. Having made this decision, and after many hours researching LaTeX typesetting programs, I discovered [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/).
