#About

After finally deciding that my future career lies in the world of software, I thought I better get with the game and make myself a personal blog/resume.

The site uses the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) engine, runs on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), and the resume page is based off [Philip Thomas' online CV](https://github.com/philipithomas/cv-philipithomas), modified to support Jekyll.
